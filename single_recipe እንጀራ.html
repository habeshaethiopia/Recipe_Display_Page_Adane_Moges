                    <h2>Ingera</h2>
                    <p>
                        Injera is traditionally made with a combination of teff flour and wheat flour. This is because
                        teff, being the world’s smallest grain, is fairly expensive and is also very intimidating in
                        terms of flavour.

                            <p>step 1: Traditional Injera Batter </p>
                            <div></div>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            <p>1. Place the teff and rice flours in a large bowl.</p>
                            <p>2. Add 70g (½ cup) of the starter.</p>
                            <p>3. Gradually add 250ml (1 cup) of the water, mixing with a wooden spoon. Add more water,
                                a little at a time, until you have a very thick batter that resists the spoon.</p>
                            <p>
                                4. Let the batter now sit for 2-3 days, covered with a kitchen paper or loosely covered
                                 with a lid, on your kitchen counter. This is the point where the batter will ferment,
                                 and at the end of it, you'll get a sour smell, much like sourdough.

                            </p>
                            <p>If you live in a warm climate, 2 days will do, otherwise, you might want to go for the
                                whole 3 days. Some of my readers have had to go 4 days. So many factors affect this.</p>
                            <p>What you are looking for is when you can see a clear fluid layer and the batter is
                                beginning to release bubbles.</p>
                            <p>In the summer, I start checking after 1 day. And the same goes if I'm keeping the batter
                                somewhere warm like the airing cupboard.</p>

                        </p>

                            <p>1. When you've reached the right stage, as described above, pour off the liquid at the
                                top.</p>
                            <p>2. In a small saucepan over high heat, boil 250ml water (1 cup). Add 80 ml (⅓ cup – use a
                                proper measuring cup) of the injera batter to the boiling water, stirring continuously.
                                Keep stirring until you get a thick porridge like batter. This is called absit.</p>
                            <p>3. Take the saucepan off the heat and transfer the absit to a bowl and leave to cool to
                                almost room temperature. This will take about an hour. </p>
                        </p>

                            <p>step 3:Final Injera Batter (another 1-2 hours) – done in a blender</p>

                        <p>
                            <p>1. When the absit has cooled, we are going to use a blender to mix everything up to give
                                us a smooth batter. This is the Ethiopian way.</p>
                            <p> In 2-3 batches, place some of the earlier Injera batter and some of the absit in your
                                blender and blend to create a smooth batter.</p>
                            <p> Place back into the original fermentation container that you used and leave to sit,
                                covered loosely for another 1-2 hours, until there are plenty of bubbles in the batter.
                                If you want this process to be fast, find a warm place. Otherwise, it may take a good 6
                                hours before you see those bubbles, which are crucial.</p>
                            <p>2. When the batter is bubbly, using a wooden spoon, stir in 250ml (1 cup) of lukewarm
                                water and 1 tsp salt. Mix well.</p>
                            <p>You are going for a pancake batter consistency. If you dip your fingers in the batter, it
                                should all just run off, leaving a thin coat on your fingers, much like warm cus</p>

                            <p>step 4: Cooking the Injera</p>
                            <div></div>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            <p>1. Ethiopians cook their Injera on a non stick electric griddle. If you have that, use
                                it, if not, a large non stick flat griddle or frying pan will do. An Indian tawa will be
                                perfect for this, if you have it.</p>
                            <p>We're going to go ahead with a non stick pan on the stove. Heat the pan over medium-high
                                heat.</p>
                            <p>2. Transfer your injera batter to a jug. When your pan has heated up, starting from the
                                outside of the pan, pour your batter from a height of about 6 inches, in a circular
                                motion, completely covering the pan.</p>
                            <p>If you need to tilt the pan to cover all of it, do it quickly, as the batter will crisp
                                up fast. But it's preferable not to tilt the pan. It may take you a couple of attempts
                                to get the hang of it.</p>
                            <p>3. At about 30 seconds, you'll start to see air pockets or holes on the surface.. Now,
                                cover the pan with a lid and cook for 1-2 minutes until the edge of the injera is
                                curling up. The sizzling sound will also have subsided quite a bit at this stage.</p>
                            <p>If your batter was on the thinner side, your injera ought to be done at 1 minute. So 1 or
                                2 minutes (or even 3) will depend on how thick your injera is.</p>
                            <p>4. Using a large, wide spatula, lift the side of the injera and slide onto a plate.</p>
                            <p>Turn the heat off and time to check on our first injera, and adjust the batter, if
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>If your injera is too soft, sticky or even worse, became a lump on the pan:</p>
                            <p>pour a little of your batter into a blender and add 40 g (¼ cup) rice flour. Blend to a
                                smooth paste, and stir this into the rest of the batter to mix thoroughly.</p>
                            <p>If your injera is too thick or dry:</p>
                            <p>stir in a little water, maybe about 2-4 Tbsp, to get a slightly thinner batter.</p>
                            <p>5. Continue cooking the rest of the injera and stack them on top of each other on the
                                plate.</p>
                            <p>You could reserve ½ cup batter to use as your starter, and store in the fridge for up to
                                1 week, for your next injera.</p>
                            <p>6. Leave the cooked injera to cool to room temperature, then cover with clingfilm and
                                leave to sit for an hour before serving.</p>
                            <p>The longer you leave the injera, the softer and tastier it will be. A day is perfect,
                                making it a great recipe for when you have guests, as it can be done the day before.</p>
