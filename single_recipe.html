                    <h2>Doro wat</h2>
                    <p>Doro wat is a traditional Ethiopian stew of chicken, eggs, and onions seasoned with a blend of
                        ginger, garlic, and spices—and specifically, berbere seasoning. Berbere,which literally means
                        “spicy” in Amharic, is a mouth-scorching mix of chili peppers, ginger, coriander, fenugreek,
                        cardamom, cinnamon, and other spices, and it’s absolutely critical to this dish. Trust me: you
                        can’t make a good, authentic doro wat without berbere.

                    <!-- single instruction -->
                    <div class="single-instruction">
                        <header>
                            <p>step 1</p>

                        <p>
                            Heat the ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced onions, and let them
                            cook undisturbed for 1 to 2 minutes. Season liberally with salt, and gently turn over the
                            pile of onions every 3 to 4 minutes to ensure even cooking.
                            Once the onions have softened and significantly reduced in volume, about 15 minutes, turn
                            the heat to medium-low.
                            Continue cooking, turning over the onion pile every 10 minutes or so, for 30 to 40 minutes
                            or until golden brown and nicely caramelized.
                            The goal is to get the onions meltingly tender and sweet—and to do it right, this will take
                            time. You know how some recipes call for cooking onions “5 minutes until caramelized”?
                            That’s a low-down dirty lie. To properly caramelize onions, you’ll want to set aside the
                            better part of an hour or more.

                            If you haven’t already minced your garlic and grated your ginger, do it already. By the way,
                            you should always keep fresh ginger root in your freezer. When you’re ready to use it, you
                            can simply break off a knob, peel off some skin, and grate it with a rasp grater like a
                            Microplane. Plus, it lasts forever in the freezer.
                            Stir the garlic and ginger into the caramelized onions, and cook until fragrant, about 30
                            seconds.
                            Add the berbere, cardamom, and black pepper and cook until fragrant.
                            Then, pour in the chicken stock…
                            Then, pour in the chicken stock…
                            Nestle the drumsticks into the liquid, and bring the contents of the pot to a low simmer.
                            Cover and cook, turning the drumsticks occasionally, for 45 minutes or until the meat is
                            tender and cooked through.

                            In the meantime, make and peel 4 hard-boiled eggs.
                            Once the chicken’s done, remove the lid of the Dutch oven and turn the heat up to
                            medium-high.
                            Cook for 5 to 10 minutes until the liquid is reduced by approximately one-third.
                            If you’re adding lime juice, do it now. The citrusy zing adds a nice, zesty brightness to
                            this long-simmered dish.
                            Cut the hard-boiled eggs into wedges.
                            Transfer the chicken drumsticks to a serving platter, garnish with the egg wedges, and ladle
                            the spicy sauce on top.
